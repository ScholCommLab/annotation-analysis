The melting pot model forwards the idea of combining foreign elements together into a homogeneous culture driven by fusion and assimilation. I believe both tracks hold problematic elements. The mosaic model can create distance between culturally differing peoples as cultural bonding processes are not required to function in society.

What I personally always yearned for in all educational experiences was “facilitated asynchronous peer reading”, if you want to call it that. I wanted that instead of having to read something together in class once again and “losing” time — that could be used for elaborating on the basis of the content on a deeper level — on getting to a common level of understanding. With H, I imagine the experience of reading homework to be exciting and eye-opening. Read the text on your own first, make markings, read it again and bring up annotations, digest those, and read it a third time with heightened understanding. Especially seminal pieces/author such as Goethe, Moon Palace or Sartre could be enriched beyond comprehension by having especially the mindful, introverted people pitching in on their own time.

This gets more exciting when you consider that different generations will be able to see how former generations have reacted to the same piece of art. That begs of course for annotation sorting options and access limited to certain groups but I am sure that is on your roadmap already.

(Found Hypothes.is a week ago and my mind is still wandering back to it regularly. Heard great podcast about W3C’s standard for copyright and had to smirk because I had been exposed to it via a tweet about H for the first time in that same week.

Fossil instead of Git is another example of this preference for simplicity. So, 1000 smaller agile communities can be possible instead of 10 big bureaucratic ones, making fork still an important right without a lot of balkanization. The open nature of these agile communities is different of private projects locked inside a company.

I have experience by myself examples of those different kind of community configurations and different thresholds for participation in the case of Debian, Arch Linux, Leo Editor or Pharo (to cite a few) and that's why the idea of agile open and small community could work, even with the proper pains of addressing complex projects/problems inside them.",2016-02-03 14:33:06.193371,2016-02-03 17:01:54.894902,

Going with the *de facto* and popular  defaults (without caring about freedom or diversity) seems the position of open source/science communities and even digital activist, which contrast sharply with their discourse for the building of tools/data/politics, but seems invisible in the building of community/metadata/metapolitics.

The kind of disempowerment these communities are trying to fight, is the one they're suffering with GitHub, like showed here: https://hypothes.is/a/AVKjLddpvTW_3w8LyrU-

So there is a tension between the convenience and wider awareness/participation of centralized privative platforms that is wanted by these open/activist communities and a growth in the (over)use of the commons that is bigger that the growth of its sustainability/ethos, as shown here: https://hypothes.is/a/AVKjfsTRvTW_3w8LyrqI .

c85o3PgeEeefDrvKrXw-Bw,81,aleenadeandra,"I remembered one time I asked my 15 year old cousin on why  he reads newspaper headlines every morning instead of just browing his twitter feeds for news. His reply was quite staggering: ""I don't believe that anyone can explain something in just 280 characters or less. They may deliver the point, but surely they are missing something. A small part. It may be crucial or it may not be. But I chose the later. It's always nice to have more rather than just enough.""

So actually there's hope for millenials.

Unfortunately, not all of them are like my cousins. Majority of them only want to know ""what's happening"" rather than ""why is it happening."" And for that, 280 characters is enough.

And if they are not busy enough to find out why is it happening .. they watch the video while doing their dishes.

First Mike Spry wrote ""No Names, Only Monsters: Toxic Masculinity, Concordia, and CanLit,"" and then Julie McIsaac responded with ""And Then a Man Said It."" Both essays were published on their own websites, and as Friday morning both remain standalone posts on their clean and simple sites. 

But in a social media driven world where it's so hard to hear as everyone is shouting, maybe we'll go back to blogging. Because that space is all about the ""democratization of writing,"" as Derakhshan says. And you can't accurately say that about social media platforms with all of their algorithms anymore.
