While I don't particularly care about the Conservative party's attendance at conferences when they are not the governing party, Gerson touches on such an interesting and not often spoken about element of our governing systems: the lobby. Lobbying is something that is exceptionally under-regulated and under-reported in Canada. These individuals, organizations, and corporations have can have significant amounts of influence on Canadian policy in an arena that very few members of the public are aware of. 

If nothing else, I appreciate Gerson's attempt to bring one important lobby group that is receiving special attention to the fore: big milk.

Gerson is a freelance writer, and so it would be interesting to question how much research she conducted as a Maclean's (or a National Post) reporter and how much she conducted independently. If it's important for policy analysis style journalism to have a supportive news organization as Murray argues, independent journalism might be the answer to that. There are many journalists out there who do their own research, their own reporting, and sell the finished products. Robert Jago comes to mind.

What is a Legacy Asset
A legacy asset is an asset that has been on the company's books for a long period of time. A legacy asset has generally decreased in value to the point of a loss for the company. This decrease in value can be due to obsolescence if the company manufactures consumer goods such as electronics. Financial companies may experience legacy assets in the form of investments that have lost their value or loans that will not be collected and so have been characterized as bad debt.

> MANIFESTO OF FUTURISM
1. We want to sing the love of danger, the habit of energy and rashness.
2. The essential elements of our poetry will be courage, audacity and
revolt.
3. Literature has up to now magnified pensive immobility, ecstasy and
slumber. **We want to exalt movements of aggression, feverish
sleeplessness, the double march, the perilous leap, the slap and the blow
with the fist.**
4. We declare that the splendor of the world has been enriched by a new
beauty: **the beauty of speed**. A racing automobile with its bonnet adorned
with great tubes like serpents with explosive breath ... a roaring motor car
which seems to run on machine-gun fire, is more beautiful than the Victory
of Samothrace.
5. We want to sing the man at the wheel, the ideal axis of which crosses
the earth, itself hurled along its orbit.
6. The poet must spend himself with warmth, glamour and prodigality to
increase the enthusiastic fervor of the primordial elements.
7. Beauty exists only in struggle. There is no masterpiece that has not an
aggressive character. Poetry must be a violent assault on the forces of the
unknown, to force them to bow before man.
8. We are on the extreme promontory of the centuries! What is the use of
looking behind at the moment when we must open the mysterious shutters
of the impossible? **Time and Space died yesterday. We are already living in
the absolute, since we have already created eternal, omnipresent speed.**
9. We want to glorify war - the only cure for the world - militarism,
patriotism, the destructive gesture of the anarchists, the beautiful ideas
which kill, and contempt for woman.
10. We want to demolish museums and libraries, fight morality, feminism
and all opportunist and utilitarian cowardice.
11. We will sing of the great crowds agitated by work, pleasure and revolt;
the multi-colored and polyphonic surf of revolutions in modern capitals: the
nocturnal vibration of the arsenals and the workshops beneath their violent
electric moons: the gluttonous railway stations devouring smoking
serpents; factories suspended from the clouds by the thread of their
smoke; bridges with the leap of gymnasts flung across the diabolic cutlery
of sunny rivers: adventurous steamers sniffing the horizon; great-breasted
locomotives, puffing on the rails like enormous steel horses with long tubes
for bridle, and the gliding flight of aeroplanes whose propeller sounds like
 the flapping of a flag and the applause of enthusiastic crowds.

Called Solid, it is based around personal online data stores, or Pods, that contain the wealth of information people generate, and are their exclusive property.
